If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
JAVA doesn't allow to do this. If you create these two constructor, they will have same name, the same type of parameter(in this case is string) and the number of input parameters(in this case is 1).
So, when we call a constructor method to use, JAVA will not know what constructor you want to call. If you want to create more than 1 constructor or 1 method in general, you must differ the name of input parameter
or type of input parameter or both of them.
